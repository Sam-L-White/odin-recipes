<h2 class="steps">Steps</h2>
<ol class="steps list">
    <li><strong>Marinate the Chicken Briefly.</strong> First, give the chicken a little flavor by tossing it with the soy sauce in a large bowl. Cover and marinate for 5 – 10 minutes, while you prepare the other ingredients.</li>
    <li><strong>Make the Sweet and Sour Sauce.</strong> Next, whisk together the pineapple juice, ketchup, rice vinegar, oyster sauce, sugar, cornstarch, and sriracha. Set this aside.</li>
    <li><strong>Prepare the Breadking Ingredients.</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and pepper. Divide this flour mixture evenly into two bowls, and whisk the egg with the water in a third bowl.</li>
    <li><strong>Bread the Chicken.</strong> Remove the chicken from the soy sauce marinade, and pat dry with paper towels. Toss the chicken pieces in one of the flour bowls, completely coating the chicken. Next, dip each piece of chicken into the whisked egg, and then into the second bowl of the flour mixture. Place the breaded chicken pieces on a plate as you go. Repeat until all the chicken pieces are breaded.</li>
    <li><strong>Cook the Chicken.</strong> Now, heat your oil over medium heat in a large wok or skillet. Once the oil is hot and shimmering, add the chicken pieces. Fry the chicken on all sides, tossing and stirring occasionally, for 5 – 7 minutes. The chicken should be crispy and golden brown.</li>
    <li><strong>Add the Sauce.</strong> Reduce the heat to medium-low, and pour the sauce over the fried chicken, gently stirring until all of the pieces are coated. Keep stirring occasionally, until the sauce has thickened, another 1 – 2 minutes.</li>
    <li><strong>Enjoy!</strong> Remove the wok from the heat, and garnish the dish with sesame seeds and chopped green onions (if using).</li>
